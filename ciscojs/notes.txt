Js is a interpreted language.
node.js- interpreter
JS uses JIT compilation, websites-client-side programming.used for interactivity and to dynamically change the content. 
JS needs 3 things: 
-code editor, interpreter(bootable environment) and debugger.
-package managers- enabling management of libraries- containing ready-made solution that we can use in our programs or components of the development enviourment.
-tast runners and module bundlers- to automate the process and merge the resulting code from many files and libraries- Grunt or webpack
-tesing framework- allows testing- mocha, jasmin jest
-security analyzers- used to control the securit of our solution- snyk, retireJS, OWASP dependency check

Interpreter- functions as a runtime environment for programms,
if we want server-side- node.js. if we want-client side- the web browser we are using

debugger- tool allows you t oslow down or halt execution of program, run instructions steb by step  and analyze state of the program
-web browser- boot environment, JS interpreted and debugger(dev tools)
browser has: inspector- to analyze html element of open website, 
JS console- shows all info about errors, debugger

defer – means that the script should be executed after the whole page is loaded;
async – means that the script will be executed immediately, but in parallel to parsing the rest of the page.
